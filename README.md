> /ˈm(j)uːˈɪndɛks/

A minimalistic Android launcher that I coded because I was annoyed that niagara launcher has a pro subscription.

## Features

### Favorites Page
You can have all of your favorite apps on one page.

### App Drawer
If you want to find an app that is not in your favorites, just drag over the letters which act as 
the scroll bar on the right hand side to land in the app drawer.

If you long press on an app, a menu pops up which gives you a few options related to the app, like:
- A button to open the apps Android settings
- A toggle to add/remove the app from the favorites.
- A toggle to hide/show the app from the app drawer.
